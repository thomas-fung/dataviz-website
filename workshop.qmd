# Hello Quarto & Shiny Dashboard

Over two fully catered days on 27 & 28 September 2024, you'll dive into
hands-on masterclass to learn how to create dashboards with

-   Quarto (<https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/>) and
-   Shiny (<https://shiny.posit.co>).

We assume you can already analyse and summarise your data in
computational notebooks with R and/or Python. This masterclass will then
enable you to share your insights or allow others to make their own
conclusions in visually appealing dashboards.
