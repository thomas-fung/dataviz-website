# 2024 Challenge

Using datasets suggested by the United Nations Datathon or any other publicly available datasets, create a static or interactive dashboard _with **ANY** of your favourite software/packages (Quarto, Shiny, Power BI, Tableau, Excel are just few such examples)_ to tell a story or highlight key insights related to one of the following themes:

-   Climate Change (<https://unstats.un.org/wiki/label/UNDatathon2023/climate-change>)
-   Digital connectivity (<https://unstats.un.org/wiki/label/UNDatathon2023/digital-connectivity>)

We selected these themes due to their significant impact on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). Climate change is directly linked to Goal #13 (<https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13>), which affects the remaining SDGs. Digital connectivity has the potential to accelerate progress towards every single one of the 17 SDGs (<https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/backgrounders/Pages/icts-to-achieve-the-united-nations-sustainable-development-goals.aspx>).

# Why focus on the UN SDGs?

Because it is a fantastic opportunity for you to demonstrate that you are prepared to tackle the complexities and challenges facing today‚Äôs society.

# Categories and Prizes üèÜ

There is a chance to win amazing prizes in two categories:

-   Best Static Visualisation
-   Best Interactive Visualisation

Prizes will be awarded at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. To qualify for the postgraduate category, your team must include at least one postgraduate student.

# Judging Criteria 

Our expert judging panel will evaluate entries based on:

-   The story told and insights offered on the chosen theme. Bonus point for linking your story/insights to UN SDG(s).

-   Creativity and aesthetic appeal

-   Effective communication

If we receive enough high-quality entries, we will host a town-hall style ceremony where you or your team can present your masterpiece to the wider university community.

# New to dashboard? No worries. We got you covered.

Over two fully catered days on 27 & 28 September, you'll dive into hands-on masterclass to learn how to create dashboards with Quarto (<https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/>) and Shiny (<https://shiny.posit.co>). _You will also earn 20 points towards the Global Leadership Program (GLP)_.

We assume you can already analyse and summarise your data in computational notebooks with R and/or Python. This masterclass will then enable you to share your insights or allow others to make their own conclusions in visually appealing dashboards.

For catering purposes, please register to the workshop when you register for DataViz 2024: <https://mqedu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1TcpY3kDpGZJRno>.

You can find out more about this masterclass [here](workshop.html).
